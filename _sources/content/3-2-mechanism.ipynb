    "The previous two privacy mechanisms, namely de-identification and $k$-anonymity, seek to achieve privacy protection by _modifying the data_. In contrast, **differential privacy** represents a privacy mechanism of _algorithms_ acting on data. Roughly speaking, an algorithm satisfies differential privacy if it cannot be used to differentiate two datasets that differ by one data record (e.g., it cannot be used to identify whether one particular individual is present or not in a dataset). An important strength of differential privacy is its mathematical rigor. The above rough definition can be made very precise, which offers a clear approach to decide whether, and how much, an algorithm satisfies differential privacy. We will discuss the precise definition of differential privacy below."

    "To illustrate the key idea first, let's think about a very simple \"algorithm\", the averaging function $f(X) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{x \\in X} x$ that simply returns the average value of a particular variable $X$. For concreteness, we can think about each $x \\in X$ being an indicator of whether an individual has cancer (which is highly sensitive information). In this case, $f(X)$ computes the proportion of cancer patients in a sample of $N$ individuals. Now, consider a particular individual with cancer indicator $x^*$ and two different datasets $D$ and $D'$ where $x^* \\in D$ and $D' = D \\setminus x^*$. In other words, the two datasets differ only by a single record $x^*$. By applying the averaging function on $D$ and $D'$, it is trivial to precisely recover the true value of $x^*$.[^footnote1] As a result, an attacker with the ability to query a dataset for average values with and without a particular row can precisely deduce the value of a sensitive feature."

    "How do we protect privacy in the above example with an averaging function? Instead of modifying the original patient dataset, the proposal of differential privacy is to **add noise to the output of the algorithm**. Specifically, consider a \"noisy\" version of the averaging function, $F(X)$ (called a \"mechanism\"), defined simply as $F(X) = f(X) + \\eta$. Note that $\\eta$ here is not a fixed value but a random variable. Now the attacker querying the dataset with $F(X)$ will have much less ability to deduce the sensitive information of any individual, because the results from applying $F(X)$ are randomized each time, thereby effectively masking the true value of any specific $x$."

While it might appear at first that more privacy protection is always better (suggesting setting $\\varepsilon$ as low as possible), it is important to realize that doing so necessarily introduces greater noise into $F(.)$, making its returned values less useful / informative. In the extreme, we can achieve (almost) perfect privacy by completely overwhelming the true values of a query by noise.
